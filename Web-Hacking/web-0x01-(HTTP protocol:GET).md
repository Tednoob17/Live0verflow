`cd /tmp`
`ls *.html`  <- list of html file contained of directory

Are you a php installed ? verify this :
`php --version` 
if you don't have php installed yet install with 
`sudo apt -y install php*` '*' because i don't know what is your php version actual and also you don't know what are all php service than you can should used in your projects.

In all case your local webserver run on **__127.0.0.1__** adress and use `8080`  port.
